##  Python-Flashcards

Variations of flashcards using Python.

### Command Line Interface (CLI) 

- [Command Line User Interface](https://github.com/jonfernq/Python-Flashcards/tree/main/CommandLineUserInterface):  An easy setting to test the underlying logic of a flashcard or multiple choice quiz app, using Python Inquirer package for CLI, and simple state and iterator design patterns. 

- [Simple Leitner System](https://github.com/jonfernq/Python-Flashcards/tree/main/CommandLineUserInterface/LeitnerSystem): A simple method of using flashcards. As they are viewed, but the flashcards in boxes graded from hardest (1) to easiest (5). With each correct answer, the card moves to a higher 'easier' box.
