## Loading Flashcards 

Flashcard can be stored and loaded into an app in various ways. 

Before some code exploring these different ways is presented, 
some general ideas about flashcard data and its repurposing for different 
learning approaches will be outlined. 

### Flashcard Data-Gathering & Restructuring

CSV spreadsheet files are the most convenient way to collect data for the initial creation of flashcards.
  
Once one starts organizing, structuring and adding information to this raw data, however, CSV files become limiting.  

For instance, flashcards for words can be structured into word frequency of usage, subject area of word as a thesaurus does.

Flashcards can also be transformed into multiple choice questions for quizzes.

Data is added to flashcards when tracking performance and mastery of the facts of flashcards.
Self-rating of mastery or a quiz score, can be added to a flashcard. 
  
A relational database allows for more facile structuring of data.  
  
We start with the flashcard data and basic descriptive information.   

### Flashcards, Decks, and Descriptors

In its most elemental form, flashcards are basically lists of points on a given topic to learn.
A list item basically looks like this:

HEAD - DESCRIPTION

In a word list of vocabulary a list item looks like this:  

bird - นก 

A cross-language meaning map. This is transformed into a flashcard
by putting the left side on the front of a flashcard and the right side on the back. 
A single flashcard is one card in a deck of flashcards, for example animal flashcards.
