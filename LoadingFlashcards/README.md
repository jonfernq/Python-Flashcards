## Loading Flashcards 

CSV spreadsheet files are the most convenient way to collect data for creation of flashcards.
  
Once one starts organizing and structuring this data, for instance into frequency of usage, 
subject area as a thesaurus does, transforming flashcards into multiple choice questions 
for quizzes, or tracking performance and mastery of the facts of flashcards, then CSV files
become limiting. 
  
A relational database allows for easy structuring of data.  
  
We start with the raw flashcard data and basic descriptive information.   

### Flashcards, Decks, and Descriptors

In its most elemental form, flashcards are basically lists of points on a given topic to learn.
A list item basically looks like this:

HEAD - DESCRIPTION

In a word list of vocabulary a list item looks like this:  

bird - นก 

A cross-language meaning map. This is transformed into a flashcard
by putting the left side on the front of a flashcard and the right side on the back. 
A single flashcard is one card in a deck of flashcards, for example animal flashcards.
