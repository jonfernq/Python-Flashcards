## Command Line User Interface

A command line user interface provides an easy setting to test the logic for user interaction with flashcards 
and multiple choice quiz questions. 

The Python Inquirer package provides a powerful interface to the command line for these purposes. 

### Flashcard Display Class

A simple class that uses Inquirer to display the front and back of flashcards and collect user responses.

It is called by a flashcard state machine class that implements each flashcard with the state design pattern
and a set (or 'deck') of flashcards with the iterator design pattern. 

It is also called by a multiple choice state machine that implements a Coursera-like quiz using the state design pattern.
